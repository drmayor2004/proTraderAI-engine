## AI Trading Engine

A custom-built AI system that leverages Binary Decision Trees and combines technical, fundamental, and market sentiment analysis to make informed trading decisions. This AI system uses machine learning algorithms to analyze vast amounts of market data, including investor sentiment, and predicts future stock prices. It utilizes technical analysis to identify trends and make short-term trades, while relying on fundamental analysis for long-term investment decisions. Market sentiment analysis is used to evaluate the overall market mood and investor confidence in a particular stock or market. The Binary Decision Trees evaluate the risk and reward of different trading strategies based on historical data, allowing the AI system to make quick, accurate trades in real-time. The integration of these advanced technologies provides a cutting-edge solution for automating the stock trading process, helping traders maximize profits and minimize losses by considering multiple factors, including market sentiment, through the power of AI.

## Concept Breakdown

***Data Collection:***
- Gathering and processing large amounts of market data including investor sentiment, financial and economic data, and stock prices.
- Using APIs and data scraping techniques to obtain real-time market data.

***Technical Analysis:***
- Evaluating charts and patterns to identify trends and make short-term trades.
- Using statistical analysis and visualization techniques to gain insights into the market.

***Fundamental Analysis:*** 
- Evaluating financial and economic data to make long-term investment decisions.
- Assessing the financial health of companies and their potential for growth.
***Market Sentiment Analysis:***
- Assessing the overall mood of the market and the confidence of investors in a particular stock or the market as a whole.
- Using natural language processing and sentiment analysis techniques to process large amounts of unstructured data

***Binary Decision Trees:*** 
- Evaluating the risk and reward of different trading decisions based on historical market data.
- Constructing the tree using nodes, which are branch points consisting of two child nodes (left and right), a condition, and a list of actions.
 -  Making use of conditions that return a boolean to determine the next move at each node.
 
***Machine Learning Algorithms:***
- Analyzing market data to make predictions about future stock prices.
- Using supervised and unsupervised learning techniques to gain insights into the market and make informed decisions.

***AI-powered Trading Engine:*** 
- Implementing the technical analysis, fundamental analysis, market sentiment analysis, and Binary Decision Trees to make informed investment decisions.
- Making quick and accurate trades in real-time based on the evaluations from the Binary Decision Trees.

***Log Management/Accountant:*** 
- Keeping a log of all the decisions made and any events triggered (like buy or sell).
- Storing the logs in a secure database for future reference and analysis.

## Challenges
***API Data Source:***

- Data Quality: Ensuring that the API data source is accurate and up-to-date, and that any errors or inconsistencies are handled effectively.
- Data Availability: Dealing with API data sources that are unreliable or become unavailable during high-traffic times.
- Data Integration: Integrating API data into the AI system in a way that allows for efficient processing and analysis.

***Coding:***

- Scalability: Ensuring that the code is scalable and can handle increasing amounts of data and transactions over time.
- Maintainability: Writing code that is easy to maintain and update, even as the AI system evolves.
- Security: Implementing strong security measures to protect against potential threats such as hacking, data theft, and other malicious activities.

***Performance:***

- Processing Speed: Ensuring that the AI system can process and analyze large amounts of data in real-time, without slowing down or causing delays.
- Resource Management: Managing the system's resources, including CPU, memory, and storage, to ensure optimal performance.
- Latency: Reducing the latency of trades, so that they are executed as quickly as possible.

***AI Engine Wrong Decisions:***

- Decision Accuracy: Ensuring that the AI engine is making accurate decisions based on the data and algorithms being used.
- Overfitting: Dealing with the potential for the AI engine to overfit to the data, leading to incorrect predictions and decisions.
- Model Bias: Preventing bias in the AI engine, which could lead to incorrect decisions and harmful consequences for traders.
